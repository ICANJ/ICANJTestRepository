Hey Guys,

So, we have a test git reporsitory called ICANJTestRepository. I will forward you the username and password. This is just a test repository. Once we have github set and working in our local work stations, let us create a proper git repository and start putting our code in it.

Enjoy Git!!!

Prayerfully,

JT
